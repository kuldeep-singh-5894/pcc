# Punjab Cricket Club Project

**Description:**
The Punjab Cricket Club (PCC) Project originated from my observation of my roommates' involvement in a local cricket team and their club. Motivated to sharpen my skills with a meaningful project, I embarked on creating a website for their club, regardless of its eventual use. This website serves as a comprehensive platform, offering information about the club, its members, and owners, while also providing an admin page for managing player information securely. Developed using servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, the project was created within the Eclipse IDE environment. The login page is securely implemented with session validation to ensure user authentication integrity.

This project not only honed my technical abilities but also showcased my dedication to leveraging technology for community benefit and personal growth.
